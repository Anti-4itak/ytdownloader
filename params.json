{"name":"YouTubeDownloader","tagline":"Android [3+] App to download YouTube video","body":"### Browse, choose a video, share to YTD and download on the device or send to a PC via SSH. From next v2.0, extract or convert audio to mp3.\r\n\r\n[**Download latest .apk**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ytdownloader/files/latest/download)\r\n\r\n## About YouTubeDownloader\r\nThe App can be accessed via the share button in the YouTube App, while watching a video.\r\nThen choose ‘YouTube Downloader’ and you will have further usage info.\r\nYou can also share any YouTube plain text link via any other App: i.e. your browser, or sharing a link via your mail App.\r\n\r\nYou’ll see all the video codecs and qualities available for the video you’re on.\r\n\r\nYou can:\r\n\r\n* Press an item to download the video locally (on the device) or to send the download via SSH to a remote PC. Destination machine requirements: Bash and Wget. Additional SSH info using the App;\r\n* Long-press an item and choose between copy to clipboard or share link as text (i.e. send to another app). Note: such a link (differently from when you send it via SSH) can be only used from the same device where it has been created OR from the same LAN, if you share it to another PC.\r\n\r\nAudio extraction feature will be available from next version (v2.0). To extract or convert the audio to mp3 from a downloaded video:\r\n* Enable the audio preference and download FFmpeg\r\n* Choose the extraction type\r\n1. 'extract only' will conserve the audio stream from the video as is (WebM files contain an 'Ogg Vorbis' audio; MP4, 3GPP and large/medium FLV video hold an 'AAC' audio stream; FLV small holds an 'mp3')\r\n2. 'extract and encode to mp3' will convert the extracted audio in an mp3, encoding it with the selected bitrate\r\n* From now on, a checkbox will appear in the download confirmation box visible when you click an item in the YTD's video list. When checked, the audio extraction job will start upon video download completion (to hide the checkbox, disable the audio extraction option)\r\n* Choose from settings if you want to remove the video file after a seccessful audio extraction\r\n\r\n## YTD LICENSE\r\nCopyright (C) 2012 **Samuele Rini**\r\n\r\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\r\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\r\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\r\n(at your option) any later version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
